    Hey, I'm a game designer from China, and this is my first time to attend a MOOC class.<br>
    My goal is to learn enough coding to support my design. Such as:<br>
    use C# in Unity & use C++ in Unreal Engine & maybe use node.js or php to make the game backend.
    <br>
    <br>
    The teacher is awesome! I've learnt some HTML before but none was this clear.<br>
    The only question that I'm confused is: this is the "programming introduction" course, and this doesn't seem to relate firmly into "HTML" at the start.<br>
    IF actually that's for a purpose, I recommend to let students know earlier why we do this.
